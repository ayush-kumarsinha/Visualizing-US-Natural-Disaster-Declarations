# Visualization of U.S. Natural Disaster Declarations

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes **U.S. Natural Disaster Declarations (1953–2025)** to understand disaster patterns across states and identify trends over time.  
The analysis focuses on identifying high-risk states, major disaster types, and seasonal storm patterns using interactive Power BI dashboards.

The project includes two dashboards:

1. **From Texas to Tennessee – Unveiling U.S. Disaster Patterns**
2. **U.S. Storm Activity: State and Seasonal Trend**

These dashboards help reveal how disasters are distributed across the United States and how storm incidents vary by state and month.

# 📊 Dashboard 1: From Texas to Tennessee – Unveiling U.S. Disaster Patterns

This dashboard provides an **overall analysis of disaster declarations across the United States from 1953 to 2025**.

### KPIs Used
- **Total Disasters**
- **Total States**
- **Total Incident Types**
- **Total HM Declared**
- **Data Coverage:** 1953 – 2025

### Visualizations Used
- Pie Chart – Count of Incident Type by Declaration Type  
- Table – Incident Type vs Total Disasters  
- Bar Chart – Total Disasters by State Name  
- Line Chart – Total Disasters by Year  

### Key Insights
- **Texas recorded the highest number of disaster declarations** among all states.
- The most common disaster type observed is **Severe Storm**.
- Disaster declarations have increased significantly in recent years.
- **2020 recorded the highest number of disasters (907)** across the United States.
- Disaster occurrences vary widely across different states and regions.

# 🌩 Dashboard 2: U.S. Storm Activity – State and Seasonal Trend

This dashboard focuses specifically on **storm-related disasters** and analyzes their yearly and monthly patterns across states.

### KPIs Used
- **Total Storm Incidents**
- **Average Storms per Year**
- **Total Disasters**

### Visualizations Used
- Bar Chart – Total Storm Incidents by State Name  
- Line Chart – Total Storm Incidents by Year  
- Line Chart – Total Storm Incidents by Month  

### Key Insights
- Storm incidents occur across almost all U.S. states.
- There is a **clear seasonal trend** in storm activity.
- Each state shows a **peak month for storm incidents**.
- Identifying these peak months helps disaster management teams prepare better.
- Focusing on high-risk months can reduce the impact of storms.
